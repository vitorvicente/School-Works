# School-Works
A collection of all my CS School Works from my time at BU.

# IMPORTANT - FOR STUDENTS
Most of the Professors that teach these classes are aware of this Repo, plagerism is a serious offense, that could get you in some real trouble (trust me as a TA I've had to deal with this and it wasn't pretty for anyone involved)... This Repo is a showcase of my work, not to serve as a base for anyone else's.

Furthermore, it should be noted that I did not have perfect grades in most of these, so use at your own risk, and don't come back crying that you got caught, I've made sure to submit this to every copyright catching mechanism BU uses...

# IMPORTANT - FOR PROFESSORS
If you'd like me to take down any material listed here, email me at vitor@bu.edu, I will remove upon request of any Professor currently teaching a class listed here (or of any Professor who will be teaching the classes in the future). This portfolio is a show of my work, but I understand that you might not want it displayed, I will honor any and all requests that are made.

# Copyright
This ePortfolio was created by compiling all works that the student Vitor Manuel Barros de Moura Vicente completed during his time at Boston University. It includes only works that relate in some way to Computer Science, thus excluding the broad set of works produced for other disciplines by the student (disciplines such as International Relation, Literature, Psychology, Journalism, etc...). It is not limited to Code as not all Computer Science skills are displayed via Code.

Although all resolutions displayed in the Repo are intellectual property of Vitor Manuel Barros de Moura Vicente, the basis/questions/assignments were provided by the Faculty running the discipline at the time, the student takes no credit for this work.

The Repo is whole encompased by the MIT License that can be found on the main folder. This requires you to quote/cite the source of any of the materials you might use. 

The Repo falls under fair use by the BU Academic Conduct policy on ePortfolios.
