    "### Twenty One\n",
    "This game is similar to the famous card game blackjack. We will play a one-player version of the game. The game is played for some number `num_trials` of rounds (we will use `num_trials` = $10^5$), at the end of which the player wins points. The player accumulates points during the whole game, and the objective is, of course, to end up with the maximum number of points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective in each round of the game is to score as close to 21 as possible by rolling a die as many times as you wish and adding all the numbers that appear. When a player's total exceeds 21, he is 'busted' and gets 0 points. If the player chooses to stop rolling before he exceeds 21, then he wins whatever his total is at that point. So for example, if a player rolls 5, 2, 4, and then 6, his total at that point is 17, and he has to decide whether it is worth trying again: he will be busted if he gets 5 or more (since 17+5=22), but will get a better total if he gets 4 or less.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many variations on this game, some involving multiple players, or a \"banker\" or different numbers of dice, or alcohol..... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_IHHNjdIEk\">here</a> is a short YT video explaining the basic game.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer can play this game with a suitable strategy. For this problem, we will consider a strategy to be simply an integer K which is the value at which you stop rolling (thinking that you are close enough to 21). The number K is fixed for the entire game. For example, if you set K = 19, then in every round, you will keep rolling if your sum to that point is less than 19; if you get a num &ge; 19 you stop. Clearly, any good strategy will be a number at least 15, since 15+6=21 and if you roll again at 15, you will never bust. But we will try all possible strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### To Do\n",
    "You should write a function <code>playRound(K)</code> which rolls a single die until you reach or exceed K or get busted, and either return your score (if you reached or exceeded K), or 0 (if you were busted). Then write a function <code>playGame()</code> which calls <code>playRound(K)</code> for N = 10,000 times for each K and returns an array of 21 numbers giving the average payoff for each K = 1, ..., 21.\n",

    "(A) For each K = 1 .. 21, what is the average payoff per round for a game played with this strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) What is the best strategy for the game, meaning what value of K wins the most points on average?\n",
    "\n",

    "## Problem 12:  The Two-Armed Bandit\n",
    "\n",
    "This game, named from a nickname for slot machines (which have\n",
    "two levers to pull and steal your money!), is played by a single player who has two coins:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $A$ with a probability of heads $p_A$, and   \n",
    "> $B$ with a probability of head $p_B$,\n",
    "  \n",
    "The coins are indistinguishable: the player does not know which coin is $A$ and which is $B$, nor the probabilities involved (of course, the game is not as interesting if the probabilities are equal!).\n",
    "\n",
    "One round of the game is played as follows: the player chooses one of the coins\n",
    "and flips it. If the result is heads, the player wins $\\$1$; if tails the player \n",
    "loses $\\$1$ (which can be thought of as a net profit of $-\\$1$). The game is played for\n",
    "some large number of rounds $n$ (though this is not important, and you might as well think of the game as continuing infinitely).\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is one of strategy: how do you maximize your profit?\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem as there is no \"strategy\" for this game, and the player might\n",
    "simply use the \"random strategy\":\n",
    "\n",
    "> RS:  In each round, flip a third, fair coin to choose either A or B.\n",
    "\n",
    " However, a strategy of \"win stay, lose shift\" has been proposed to\n",
    "optimize one's chances of success.  This strategy is simple: \n",
    "\n",
    ">  WSLS:  In the first round, use coin A. After that, if you win, \n",
    ">  then flip the same coin again; if you lose, switch to the other coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy has an intuitive appeal, because you would think that over a large\n",
    "number of rounds, the coin with the higher probability would tend to be flipped\n",
    "more often, resulting in more profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, no one has (yet) come up with a rigorous proof that this strategy is\n",
    "better than the random strategy. Hence we must fall back on experiments. \n",
    "In this problem we will investigate these\n",
    "two strategies and see if indeed the \"win stay, lose shift\" strategy is better\n",
    "than the random strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, complete the template below to implement the basic framework for the game, then try the following experiments. Code to print out the results has been included,\n",
    "you must provide the code to implement each strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "(A)  Set pa = pb = 0.6.  In this case, both strategies should be equivalent. Run \n",
    "the game for $10^5$ rounds ($10^6$ if you can) and print out the results, they\n",
    "should be very close.\n",
    "\n",
    "(B)  Set pa = 0.6 and pb = 0.5 and run for $10^5$ rounds ($10^6$ if you can). You should\n",
    "see modest improvement using WSLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "(C)  Set pa = 0.75 and pb = 0.25 and run for $10^5$ rounds ($10^6$ if you can). You should see a fairly dramatic improvement using WSLS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try this without the seed (commenting out the line `np.random.seed(0)`, in which case you will see the general trend of\n",
    "these experiments, and then include the seed before you submit.  The comments below\n",
    "on what results you should see assume you have used the seed. \n"
