The model doesn't need to be fancy, you can aim for a \"baseline\" model with basic preprocessing that achieves reasonable accuracy of at least 80% on the test dataset. For example, Linear Regression on Bag of Words should be sufficient, but feel free to explore more powerful model families. We recommend keeping it simple and use the `sklearn` package. Finally, you will store your model so that you will be able to load it into the notebook in class.\n","\n","Please go through the whole notebook before you start coding.
